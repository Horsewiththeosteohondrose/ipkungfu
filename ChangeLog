--0.6.0--
04-01-2006: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* ChangeLog:
	Updated Changelog.
04-01-2006: Rocco Stanzione <grasshopper@linuxkungfu.org>

	Small documentation updates.
20-12-2005: Rocco Stanzione <grasshopper@linuxkungfu.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	Fix some typos and a bug reported by dooglus.
18-12-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	Fixed a disrespect to the INIT seeting that was causing some output when
	there should be none.
	Fixed output that also shouldn't exist introduced by the need to pass only
	'-c' to the md5sum binary, closes bug #34.
	Added a check for MARK packets support, closes bug #33.
	The rule to test TOS support is now done on the SYSTEST chain also.
	Fixed bug #35, ipkungfu will now stop if it's own md5 sig check fails.
	Fixed the creation of the services.conf file from the user defined
	ALLOWED_*_IN.
	* Makefile.am:
	Upon 'make install' we now remove /etc/ipkungfu/cache.
13-12-2005: Rocco Stanzione <grasshopper@linuxkungfu.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	Fixed a few typos and reword a warning.
08-12-2005: Rocco Stanzione <grasshopper@linuxkungfu.org>
	* ipkungfu.in, advanced.conf:
	Optionally disallow packets from the internal network with state
	'INVALID'. On by default and applied only to tcp and udp.
08-12-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	IPKungFu no longer sed's himself, instead, it creates some "behaviour
	files" on the cache dir.
	* configure.ac:
	The md5sum binary is now a necessary dependency.
29-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	On Linux knoppix 3.6, when checking md5 signatures, the md5sum binary
	didn't accepted --check nor ---status. The solution was to use -c, the
	short arg for checking, redirect any output to /dev/null and check the
	exit code of the command to see if the signature check was good.
28-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* configure.ac:
	Fixed a problem when using 'make install-config'. If a user just did
	'./configure && make && make install && make install-config', the config
	files would end up on '/usr/local/etc/ipkungfu/'.
	Removed some un-necessary text.
	* ipkungfu.in:
	Removed some redirects to 'logError()' which were making ipkungfu report
	wrong '$?' exit codes.
	Removed some un-necessary bash childs.
	* files/conf/services.conf:
	Added an msn messenger example that probably will need to be removed.
27-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	Removed some un-necessary bash childs.
	Improved some of the code's readability.
	Added yet another 'until loop' wich only runs in case the rule target is
	bigger than 6 chars wide to match the 'Target' header label.
27-11-2005: Rocco Stanzione <grasshopper@linuxkungfu.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	Removed some possible infinitive loops.
	Fixed some typos.
25-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	IPKungFu now check's it's own md5sum integrity IF it's not the first time
	it's running.
	Improved --d|--disable argument of ipkungfu, it should respect the value
	of INIT, else, the init scripts made by distros will show output when no
	output should exist.
	Improved the caching behaviour of IPKungFu.
23-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	Output is now all ligned up correctly no mater how long or how short the
	services name and port are.
	IPKungFu now accepts iptables log messages with blank spaces, for this,
	fwLog was replaced by setupLogging() which sets up our $LOG_CMD to use on
	the iptables calls.
22-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	We now don't use any color-codes to colorize the output	of ipkungfu
	anymore, we use variables to do that for us. So if we want to change a
	color, we only need to do it in one place.
	handleAcceptTcpServices and handleAcceptUdpServices don't exist anymore,
	because they're now treated with handleServices, which was previoulsly
	known as handleOtherServices.
21-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* ipkungfu.in:
	IPKungFu now has the ability to create the services.conf file for the
	user. 
10-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* services.conf:
	If a service name is a blank string, ipkungfu will check for it in
	'/etc/services'. User might want ipkungfu to grab the service name from
	'/etc/services' instead of 'services.conf'.
09-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* loadKernelModules():
	The default kernel modules will be checked for presence in the filesystem,
	if found load them, if not found assume they're built into the kernel.
	This will prevent the output of errors while loading ip_nat_irc,
	ip_conntrack_ftp, ip_nat_ftp, ip_conntrack_irc, if these are built into
	the kernel.
	Fixed error logging support while trying to load kernel modules, was badly
	redirecting STDERR to our logError() function.
	* logError():
	In case logError() function get's called without any message, it won't log
	anything.
08-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* --failsafe argument:
	Now, passing '--failsafe' will override the users FAILSAFE setting in
	'ipkungfu.conf'.
06-11-2005: Rocco Stanzione <grasshopper@linuxkungfu.org>
	* TOS Support Check:
	Added a test for TOS support.
02-11-2005: Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* Fixed REGEX Expresion:
	Fixed REGEX Expresion when passing '-l' or '--list' to ipkungfu
	* configurable list of conntrack modules:
	Added support to load a configurable list of conntrack modules.
	* Run-Time Error Logging:
	Added run-tim error logging support.
26-10-2005 Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org>
	* Iptables Rules Caching Support Added:
	Added rules caching support to use with iptables-save and
	iptables-restore, which saves a lot of time loading ipkungfu.
23-10-2005 Pedro Algarvio <ufs@ufsoft.org> and Chandler Carruth <chandlerc@retina-software.com>:
	* Autonconf support:
	IPKungFu now support's the GNU Standard.
